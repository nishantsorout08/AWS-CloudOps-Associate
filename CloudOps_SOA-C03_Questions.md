## Question 232

A company analyzes sales data for its customers. Customers upload files to one of the company's Amazon S3 buckets, and a message is posted to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue that contains the object Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An application that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance polls the queue and processes the messages. The processing time depends on the size of the file. Customers are reporting delays in the processing of their files. A CloudOps Engineer decides to configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling as the first step.

- **C.** Create a custom metric based on the `ASGAverageCPUUtilization` metric and the GroupPendingInstances metric from the Auto Scaling group. Modify the application to calculate the metric and post the metric to Amazon CloudWatch once each minute. Create an Auto Scaling policy based on this metric to scale the number of instances.
- **D.** Create a custom metric based on the `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` metric and the number of instances in the `InService` state in the Auto Scaling group.
