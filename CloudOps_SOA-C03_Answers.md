## Question 267

A company hosts an internal application on Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The instances are in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. Employees use the application to provide product prices to potential customers. The Auto Scaling group is configured with a dynamic scaling policy and tracks average CPU utilization of the instances. Employees have noticed that sometimes the application becomes slow or unresponsive. A CloudOps Engineer finds that some instances are experiencing a high CPU load. The Auto Scaling group cannot scale out because the company is reaching the EC2 instance service quota.

## Question 386

A CloudOps Engineer created an AWS Lambda function within a `VPC` with no access to the Internet. The Lambda function pulls messages from an Amazon SQS queue and stores them in an Amazon RDS instance in the same `VPC`. After executing the Lambda function, the data is not showing up on the RDS instance. Which of the following are possible causes for this? (Choose two.)

**Answer:**
- B) A `VPC` endpoint has not been created for Amazon SQS.
- C) The RDS security group is not allowing connections from the Lambda function.

## Question 387

A user has created a `VPC` with public and private subnets using the `VPC` wizard. Which of the below mentioned statements is not true in this scenario?

**Answer:** A) The `VPC` will create a routing instance and attach it with a public subnet.

## Question 388

A company has an application that uses a scheduled AWS Lambda function to retrieve datasets from external sources over the internet. The function is not associated with a `VPC`. The company is modifying the application to store the information that the Lambda function retrieves on an Amazon RDS DB instance in a private subnet. The `VPC` has two public subnets and two private subnets. A CloudOps Engineer must deploy a solution that allows the Lambda function to access the new database and continue to access the internet. Which solution meets these requirements?

**Answer:** C) Reconfigure the Lambda function for `VPC` access. Add `NAT` gateways to the public subnets in the VPAdd route table entries in the private subnets to route through the `NAT` gateways to the internet. Attach the function to the private subnets that support the database. Associate a security group with the function. Configure the security group outbound rules to allow Lambda to access the internet.

## Question 389

A user has created a `VPC` with public and private subnets using the `VPC` wizard. The `VPC` has `CIDR` `20.0.0.0/16`. The private subnet uses `CIDR` `20.0.0.0/24`. The `NAT` instance ID is `i-a12345`. Which of the below mentioned entries are required in the main route table attached with the private subnet to allow instances to connect with the internet?

**Answer:** A) Destination: `0.0.0.0/0` and Target: `i-a12345`.

## Question 390

A user has created a `VPC` with public and private subnets using the `VPC` wizard. Which of the below mentioned statements is true in this scenario?

**Answer:** B) `VPC` bounds the main route table with a private subnet and a custom route table with a public subnet.

---

## Question 391

A user has created a `VPC` with public and private subnets using the `VPC` Wizard. The `VPC` has `CIDR` `20.0.0.0/16`. The private subnet uses `CIDR` `20.0.0.0/24`. Which of the below mentioned entries are required in the main route table to allow the instances in `VPC` to communicate with each other?

**Answer:** B) Destination: `20.0.0.0/16` and Target: `Local`.

---

## Question 392

A user has created a `VPC` with public and private subnets using the `VPC` wizard. The user has not launched any instance manually and is trying to delete the `VPC`. What will happen in this scenario?

**Answer:** D) It will not allow to delete the `VPC` since it has a running `NAT` instance.

---

## Question 393

A user has created a `VPC` with the public and private subnets using the `VPC` wizard. The `VPC` has `CIDR` `20.0.0.0/16`. The public subnet uses `CIDR` `20.0.1.0/24`. The user is planning to host a web server in the public subnet (port `80`) and a DB server in the private subnet (port `3306`). The user is configuring a security group for the public subnet (`WebSecGrp`) and the private subnet (`DBSecGrp`). Which of the below mentioned entries is required in the web server security group (`WebSecGrp`)?

**Answer:** D) Configure port `80` inbound for source `20.0.0.0/16`.

---

## Question 394

A user has created a `VPC` with `CIDR` `20.0.0.0/16` using the wizard. The user has created a public subnet `CIDR` `20.0.0.0/24` and `VPN` only subnets `CIDR` `20.0.1.0/24` along with the `VPN` gateway `vgw-12345` to connect to the user's data center. Which of the below mentioned options is a valid entry for the main route table in this scenario?

**Answer:** D) Destination: `0.0.0.0/0` and Target: `vgw-12345`.

---

## Question 395

A user has created a `VPC` with the public and private subnets using the `VPC` wizard. The `VPC` has `CIDR` `20.0.0.0/16`. The public subnet uses `CIDR` `20.0.1.0/24`. The user is planning to host a web server in the public subnet (port `80`) and a DB server in the private subnet (port `3306`). The user is configuring a security group for the public subnet (`WebSecGrp`) and the private subnet (`DBSecGrp`). Which of the below mentioned entries is required in the private subnet database security group (`DBSecGrp`)?

**Answer:** A) Allow inbound on port `3306` for source Web Server Security Group (`WebSecGrp`).

---

## Question 396

A user has created a `VPC` with `CIDR` `20.0.0.0/16` using `VPC` Wizard. The user has created a public `CIDR` `20.0.0.0/24` and a `VPN` only subnet `CIDR` `20.0.1.0/24` along with the hardware `VPN` access to connect to the user's data center. Which of the below mentioned components is not present when the `VPC` is setup with the wizard?

**Answer:** B) A `NAT` instance configured to allow the `VPN` subnet instances to connect with the internet.

---

## Question 397

A user has created a `VPC` with `CIDR` `20.0.0.0/16` using the wizard. The user has created public and `VPN` only subnets along with hardware `VPN` access to connect to the user's data center. The user has not yet launched any instance as well as modified or deleted any setup. He wants to delete this `VPC` from the console. Will the console allow the user to delete the `VPC`?

**Answer:** B) No, the console will ask the user to manually detach the virtual private gateway first and then allow deleting the `VPC`.

## Question 398

A user has created a `VPC` with `CIDR` `20.0.0.0/16` using the wizard. The user has created a public subnet `CIDR` `20.0.0.0/24` and `VPN` only subnets `CIDR` `20.0.1.0/24` along with the `VPN` gateway `vgw-12345` to connect to the user's data center. The user's data center has `CIDR` `172.28.0.0/12`. The user has also setup a `NAT` instance `i-123456` to allow traffic to the internet from the `VPN` subnet. Which of the below mentioned options is not a valid entry for the main route table in this scenario?

**Answer:** A) Destination: `20.0.1.0/24` and Target: `i-12345`.
